# Bots-for-charity
This is the start of a project I would like to keep developing as I grow my skills. It is important to me to give back, and this is a way I have found to:
This is a bot designed to play and interact with kids that are in the hospital and cannot interact with others safely.
It features three games for now.

## Hangman "/hangman"
Plays hangman with the user using a given list of words available that can be scaled. Implementation using OOP, namely a simple Hangman class.

## Interactive story "/story"
Tells the beginning of a story that is designed to have different outcomes, and the user chooses the one it wants to adventure in. He is handed a series of decisions that make his own story. Implementation with Trees.

## Arithmetic game "/math"
Given a user level, it asks a series of arithmetic questions that the user can answer using the /answer command. Implementation using the random module.

## PS
Please let me know if you have any suggestions for me to improve on my bot! Also, if you would like to provide a story for the interactive story module, please send your recommendation to my email, I will gladly accept suggestions.
